installed Debian 11.11, the one I have been runing since 2021, as I could not
remember the exact date and time it was installed on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find a couple of possible options, which I shared on this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://porfiriopaiz.github.io/site/posts/2025/08/24/debian-age.html"&gt;https://porfiriopaiz.github.io/site/posts/2025/08/24/debian-age.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after more that 4 years of using Debian 11.11, I have finally decided to
upgrade to Debian 12.12 Bookworm. I will cover the steps I took to perform the
upgrade, and some of the issues I faced during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I will share with you some of the things I wanted to preserve from the
current installation before the upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;
