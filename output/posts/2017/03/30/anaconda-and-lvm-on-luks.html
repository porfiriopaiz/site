  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I previously upgraded my laptop from Fedora 22 to Fedora 23 after F22 had been
in its End of Life state for over six months. Notably, you can efficiently
reuse partitions originally configured for F22, ensuring they seamlessly
accommodate the installation of the new Fedora release while preserving all
files within the Logical Volume designated as <tt class="docutils literal">/home</tt>.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll guide you through achieving this without compromising the
integrity of our data or other operating systems installed on your
Desktop/Laptop.</p>
<p>As discussed in the earlier post, while upgrades are an option, I'm personally
inclined towards fresh installs. Resetting everything to its prior state brings
a sense of satisfaction. Moreover, it places less strain on the computer,
downloading only the essential packages for a functional system. Additional
software can be installed on demand later.</p>
<p>Once a proper backup of all our system files is secured, we can embark on the
installation process without the nagging fear of the unknown. After all, you
never truly know what could go wrong until it does – that's the beauty of it!
XD</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-an-installation-media">
<h2>Creating an Installation Media</h2>
<p>Our initial step involves crafting an installation medium, and to kickstart
this process, we need to download the Fedora 25 ISO file. For consistency, I've
been relying on the netinstall image since Fedora 21, as highlighted in Chapter
2 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/25/html/Installation_Guide/chap-downloading-fedora.html">Fedora Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The netinstall image boots directly into the installation environment, and
uses the online Fedora package repositories as the installation source.
With a netinstall image, you can select a wide variety of packages to
create a customized installation of Fedora.</p>
<p>The Fedora Server netinstall image is a universal one, and can be used to
install any Fedora flavor or your own set of favorite packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="section" id="downloading-the-image-everything-netinstall">
<h3>Downloading the image Everything netinstall</h3>
<p>I prefer utilizing the netinstall ISO image of <a class="reference external" href="https://alt.fedoraproject.org/en/">Fedora Everything</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the Everything netinstall image lacks a torrent
seeder for download, as indicated by the absence on the <a class="reference external" href="https://torrent.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora torrent page</a>. As a result, we'll have to resort to
the conventional method of direct download, and for this, we'll leverage the
command line.</p>
<p>For 32-bit systems, employ the following command to download the image:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">wget -N -t 0 -c https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/25/Everything/i386/iso/Fedora-Everything-netinst-i386-25-1.3.iso</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For 64-bit systems, employ the following command to initiate the image
download:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">wget -N -t 0 -c https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/25/Everything/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Everything-netinst-x86_64-25-1.3.iso</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the command options:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>-N</cite> ensures the downloaded file retains the original time and date stamp
from its initial upload to the servers.</p>
<p><cite>-t 0</cite> serves as a safety net; if the download encounters connectivity
issues, it will automatically attempt to reconnect. Leaving the time at <cite>0</cite>
ensures an immediate reconnection.</p>
<p><cite>-c</cite> signals that the download should resume from the byte where it was
left pending in case of interruptions. This precaution is particularly useful
for scenarios with less stable network connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provides a small contingency measure in the event of an unstable network.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can verify the integrity of the downloaded image using the
checksum file. Simply download the checksum file and save it in the same
directory as the ISO image:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">wget -N -t 0 -c https://alt.fedoraproject.org/es/static/checksums/Fedora-Everything-25-1.3-x86_64-CHECKSUM</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next, execute the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">sha256sum -c Fedora-Everything-25-1.3-x86_64-CHECKSUM</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-the-iso-image-on-a-usb">
<h3>Writing the ISO image on a USB</h3>
<p>To write the ISO image onto a USB drive, we'll employ the <strong>Fedora Media
Writer</strong> tool. If you're on Windows, you can install Fedora Media Writer using
the following link:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org/fmw/FedoraMediaWriter-win32-4.0.7.exe">https://getfedora.org/fmw/FedoraMediaWriter-win32-4.0.7.exe</a></p>
<p>For MacOS users, the link is:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org/fmw/FedoraMediaWriter-osx-4.0.7.dmg">https://getfedora.org/fmw/FedoraMediaWriter-osx-4.0.7.dmg</a></p>
<p>If you're using Fedora 23 or a later version, you can install Fedora Media
Writer with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">su -c &#39;dnf install mediawriter&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Before launching Fedora Media Writer, it's recommended to disconnect any
removable storage devices currently plugged into your system. This precaution
helps avoid potential confusion. Once that's done, connect the USB memory you
intend to use and proceed to run Fedora Media Writer.</p>
<p>The steps are straightforward:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Choose &quot;Custom image.&quot;</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory where the ISO image was downloaded.</li>
<li>Select the USB drive.</li>
<li>Click on <cite>Write to disk</cite>.</li>
<li>Enter your user password if you belong to the <cite>wheel</cite> group, or provide the
<cite>root</cite> password if you are not in the admins group.</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="booting-from-usb">
<h3>Booting from USB</h3>
<p>In configuring my laptop, I've set it to start up in <cite>UEFI mode</cite> while keeping
the trusty <cite>Secure Boot</cite> feature engaged.</p>
<p>When crafting the installation media using Fedora Media Writer, it serves as a
reliable assurance that it'll seamlessly adapt to various scenarios.</p>
<p>To access the Boot Manager on my laptop, a simple press of the <strong>Enter</strong> key
during the appearance of the <strong>Lenovo</strong> logo is indicative of the system's
initiation in UEFI mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-the-fedora-25-installation-process">
<h2>Starting the Fedora 25 Installation Process</h2>
<p>In this section of the post, I'll provide screenshots along with brief
descriptions.</p>
<p>Let's start with the Internet connection.</p>
<p>The installation media created from netinstall images relies solely on an
Internet connection, which can be established either through a wired connection
via the RJ45 port (Ethernet) or wirelessly using our WiFi card. In my case, the
netinstall setup effortlessly detects both network cards. Fedora netinstall
includes a range of drivers that enable the utilization of certain network
cards. If your network card isn't detected, it may be due to the device not
being supported by Fedora, typically for legal reasons. Fedora strictly
incorporates FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) drivers or drivers
whose manufacturers explicitly outline their terms of use and distribution
policy.</p>
<p>My T440p is equipped with an <a class="reference external" href="https://ark.intel.com/products/60019/Intel-Ethernet-Connection-I217-LM">Intel® Ethernet Wired Network Card Connection
I217-LM</a> and
an <a class="reference external" href="http://ark.intel.com/products/75174/Intel-Wireless-N-7260">Intel® Wireless-N 7260 Wireless Network Card</a>. During
installation, both cards were promptly detected. As I have access only to WiFi
networks in the office, I opted to use the Wireless card.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0000.png" />
<p>In this initial image of the installation summary, our first step is to
establish a connection to any of the available networks, be it through a wired
or WiFi network. To achieve this, click on <cite>NETWORK &amp; HOST NAME</cite>.</p>
<p>Next, choose Wireless and enable the corresponding network card. From the list
of available networks, select one, alter the name of your Desktop/Laptop as
desired, and then click <cite>Apply</cite>...</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0002.png" />
<p>Click <cite>Done</cite>.</p>
<p>In the <cite>LOCALIZATION</cite> section, I included the option for <tt class="docutils literal">French
(International, AltGr dead keys)</tt> while removing <tt class="docutils literal">English (US)</tt>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0005.png" />
<p>You can perform a quick test by pressing the <cite>AltGr + a</cite> key and other vowels
to observe the accentuated vowels.</p>
<p>In the <cite>TIME &amp; DATE</cite> section, I consistently enable <cite>Network Time</cite>...</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0007.png" />
<p>Additionally, we choose our <cite>Region</cite> and <cite>City</cite>, and based on this selection,
the time and date are automatically set.</p>
<p>So far, we've configured the following sections:</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0008.png" />
<p>Now, let's proceed to configure the <cite>SOFTWARE</cite> section, focusing on the
<cite>INSTALLATION SOURCE</cite>...</p>
<p>In this section, we check <cite>On the Network:</cite> and choose <cite>Closest mirror</cite>.
Additionally, ensure to uncheck the <cite>Updates</cite> option...</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0009.png" />
<p>This setup ensures that the installer utilizes online repositories to download
the necessary packages for installation. It dynamically selects the nearest
server, which may not necessarily be the closest geographically but is
typically the most efficient with optimal data transfer times.</p>
<p>By leaving <cite>Updates</cite> unchecked, we instruct the installer to deploy the latest
available packages from the repository.</p>
<p>We patiently wait for the download of package group metadata as the <cite>SOFTWARE
SELECTION</cite> section depends on this step.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0011.png" />
<p>In the <cite>SOFTWARE SELECTION</cite> section, I opted for <cite>Fedora Custom Operating
System</cite>, representing a minimal package selection. This choice excludes a
graphical environment, including only a few essential package groups, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">Environment Group: Fedora Custom Operating System</span>
<span class="go"> Environment-Id: custom-environment</span>
<span class="go"> Description: Basic building block for a custom Fedora system.</span>
<span class="go"> Mandatory Groups:</span>
<span class="go">   Core</span>
<span class="go"> Optional Groups:</span>
<span class="go">   Guest Agents</span>
<span class="go">   Standard</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, we've arrived at the <cite>SYSTEM</cite> section. Choose <cite>INSTALLATION
DESTINATION</cite>. Under <cite>Device Selection</cite>, in <cite>Local Standard Disk</cite>, select the
hard disk containing the existing Fedora installation with the partitions you
wish to reuse.</p>
<p>In the <cite>Other Storage Options</cite> section, within the <cite>Partitioning</cite> category,
select <cite>I will Configure partitioning</cite>.</p>
<p>The subsequent menu is displayed below, where we'll click on <cite>Unknown</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0013.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Once we click <cite>Unknown</cite> the other existing partitions will be displayed. we
will focus on the partitions <strong>sda2</strong>, <strong>sda9</strong> and <strong>sda10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0014.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a detailed breakdown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>sda2</strong>: This is the ESP (EFI System Partition), housing other *.efi files.
Each OS installed in UEFI mode has an *.efi file linked to our GRUB. It
enables us to choose the OS during the initial seconds after turning on our
computer. <strong>Never mark</strong> this partition for formatting. <strong>sda2</strong> will be
mounted on <cite>/boot/efi</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>sda9</strong>: This partition will be mounted in <cite>/boot</cite> and should not be
encrypted. It contains crucial files needed for the OS to load, such as the
kernel. Encrypting this partition would prevent the loading of kernels during
boot.</p>
<p><strong>sda10</strong>: This partition is encrypted using LUKS and houses the <cite>Volume
Group</cite>, which, in turn, contains other logical volumes serving as <cite>/</cite>, <cite>/home</cite>,
and <cite>swap</cite>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once <strong>sda10</strong> is selected, you'll be prompted for the encryption password
granting access to the <cite>Volume Group</cite>, which includes the mentioned partitions.
This section reflects the existing Fedora 23 installation, originally the F22
that we updated in the previous post.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0015.png" />
<p>Click on <cite>Fedora Linux 23 for x86_64</cite>, and you'll be able to view the logical
volumes slated for reuse.</p>
<p>When selecting <cite>/home</cite>, ensure to allocate a <cite>Mount Point</cite> for this Logical
Volume. Make certain that the <cite>Reformat</cite> checkbox is <strong>not</strong> selected, then
click on <cite>Update Settings</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0017.png" />
<p>In the subsequent image, you'll observe that the logical volume
<cite>fedora_lilit-home</cite> has been reallocated to the <cite>New Fedora 25 Installation</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0018.png" />
<p>Choose <cite>/boot/efi</cite>, equivalent to the ESP partition located in <strong>sda2</strong>. Ensure
to assign a <cite>Mount Point</cite> for this Logical Volume, which, in this case, would
be <cite>/boot/efi</cite>. Confirm that the checkbox <cite>Reformat</cite> is <strong>not</strong> selected, then
click on <cite>Update Settings</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0019.png" />
<p>Choose <cite>/</cite>. This logical volume previously served as the <cite>/</cite> for F23, so for
reuse, we need to mark it for formatting. Assign <cite>/</cite> as the mount point, select
the file system as ext4, ensure that the checkbox <cite>Reformat</cite> <strong>is</strong> marked, and
then click on <cite>Update Settings</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0023.png" />
<p>Select <cite>swap</cite>, mark the checkbox and click <cite>Update Settings</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0025.png" />
<p>Opt for <cite>/boot</cite>. This is where the F23 kernels were stored, so to repurpose
this partition, formatting is necessary. Allocate the <cite>Mount Point</cite> as <cite>/boot</cite>,
check the <cite>Reformat</cite> option, specify the file system as ext4 (in my case), and
click on <cite>Update Settings</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0030.png" />
<p>Click on <cite>Done</cite> and confirm the impending changes.</p>
<p>To conclude, simply click on <cite>Begin Installation</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0032.png" />
<p>Assign both a user password and a ROOT password. Now, patiently wait for the
download and installation of the packages to complete.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0037.png" />
<p>Once everything is set, click on <cite>Reboot</cite>.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-center" src="../../../../images/anaconda-screenshots/0053.png" />
<p>In my case, I had to perform a series of post-installation steps, which I'll
elaborate on in the next post.</p>
