On Tuesday, March 14th, the `Fedora Nicaragua <http://fedora.org.ni/>`_
community and the `CS50x.ni <http://code-fu.net.ni/>`_ staff, with the support
of `Fundación UNO <http://fundacionuno.org/en/>`_ and the Fedora Project, came
together for a series of lectures. These sessions provided insights into using
Free Software, emphasizing the importance and benefits of the various tools
utilized in the CS50x.ni course. The lectures were open to current CS50x.ni
participants, prospective students, and anyone interested in learning more
about Free Software, particularly the Fedora Project.

The event took place in the basement of the north wing of the Rigoberto López
Pérez building at the National University of Engineering's Simón Bolívar
Campus, in classrooms designated for the CS50x.ni (Coding) project.

The talks started at 9:00 AM. The first presentation, `"Fedora Project
