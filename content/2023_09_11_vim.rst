 Understanding ``vim`` on Debian
=================================

Now that I understand how Debian manages ``vi`` and ``vim`` and I've grasped the
purpose of the vim-tiny package, it's time to determine the requirements for
obtaining a more advanced ``vim`` binary with enhanced features or support for
additional functionalities.

A brief search for additional information on ``vim-tiny`` suggests various
alternatives for a more comprehensive ``vim`` experience:

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ apt-cache show vim-tiny
   Package: vim-tiny
   Source: vim
   Version: 2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1

   Depends: vim-common (= 2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1), libacl1 (>= 2.2.23), libc6 (>= 2.15), libselinux1 (>= 3.1~), libtinfo6 (>= 6)

    .
    This package contains a minimal version of Vim compiled with no GUI and
    a small subset of features. This package's sole purpose is to provide
    the vi binary for base installations.
    .
    If a vim binary is wanted, try one of the following more featureful
    packages: vim, vim-nox, vim-athena, or vim-gtk3.

Running both ``apt-cache show vim-athena`` and ``apt-cache show vim-gtk3`` reveals
that both packages offer a graphical user interface, which I neither desire nor
require.

``apt-cache show vim`` displays information that suggests this could be the
solution I've been searching for:

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ apt-cache show vim
   Package: vim
   Version: 2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1
   Installed-Size: 3286

   Description-en: Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor

    .
    Many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
    highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
    completion, block operations, folding, Unicode support, etc.
    .
    This package contains a version of vim compiled with a rather
    standard set of features.  This package does not provide a GUI
    version of Vim.  See the other vim-* packages if you need more
    (or less).

And ``apt-cache show vim-nox`` shows me that ``vim-nox`` provides support for
scripting languages, Python among them, which is missing from the bare minimum
option provided by the ``vim`` package.

So I installed it:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c “apt-get install vim-nox”

The first thing I noticed after installing ``vim-nox`` is that now ``vi``
points to ``vim.nox``, meaning that when running ``vi`` it will be actually
running ``vim.nox``, which is not what I was expecting.

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ whereis vi
   vi: /usr/bin/vi /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1.gz
   pionen@lilit:~$ ls -la /usr/bin/vi
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 May 28  2021 /usr/bin/vi -> /etc/alternatives/vi
   pionen@lilit:~$ ls -la /etc/alternatives/vi
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Oct 12  2022 /etc/alternatives/vi -> /usr/bin/vim.nox

I really struggled to find a fix for this, it took me a while to get to the
answer, but I found it:

https://superuser.com/questions/852177/why-does-the-vi-command-open-vim-editor/852219#852219

I just need to run ``vim`` and addition pass some parameters next to it:

.. code-block:: console

   vim -u NONE

Later I found the same suggestion on the ``/usr/share/vim/vim82/defaults.vim``
file:

.. code-block:: console

   " This is loaded if no vimrc file was found.
   " Except when Vim is run with "-u NONE" or "-C".
   " Individual settings can be reverted with ":set option&".
   " Other commands can be reverted as mentioned below.

It's quite convenient to have the ability to run ``vi`` without loading any
additional features from ``vim-nox`` when you simply need to make a minor edit,
without relying on plugins and such. To simplify this, I added the following
line to my ``~/.bash_aliases`` file. This ensures that when I run ``vi`` it loads
``vim-nox`` without any settings or features from configuration files such as
``/etc/vim/vimrc`` ``/usr/share/vim/vim82/debian.vim`` or
``/usr/share/vim/vim82/defaults.vim``:

Here's the code snippet I added to my ``~/.bash_aliases`` file to ensure ``vi``
runs ``vim-nox`` without any additional settings:

.. code-block:: console

   # Alias to run vi instead of vim.nox
   alias vi="vim -u NONE"

With this configuration, I'm all set! In the future, I'll be sharing my
``~/.vimrc`` file and its contents.
