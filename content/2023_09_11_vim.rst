Understanding ``vim`` on Debian
===============================

Now that I understand how Debian manages ``vi`` and ``vim`` and I've grasped
the purpose of the ``vim-tiny`` package, it's time to determine the
requirements for obtaining a more advanced ``vim`` binary with enhanced
features or support for additional functionalities.

A brief search for additional information on ``vim-tiny`` suggests various
alternatives for a more comprehensive ``vim`` experience:

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ apt-cache show vim-tiny
   Package: vim-tiny
   Source: vim
   Version: 2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1

   Maintainer: Debian Vim Maintainers <team+vim@tracker.debian.org>
   Architecture: amd64
   Provides: editor
   Depends: vim-common (= 2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1), libacl1 (>= 2.2.23), libc6 (>= 2.15), libselinux1 (>= 3.1~), libtinfo6 (>= 6)

    .
    This package contains a minimal version of Vim compiled with no GUI and
    a small subset of features. This package's sole purpose is to provide
    the vi binary for base installations.
    .
    If a vim binary is wanted, try one of the following more featureful
    packages: vim, vim-nox, vim-athena, or vim-gtk3.

Running both ``apt-cache show vim-athena`` and ``apt-cache show vim-gtk3``
reveals that both packages offer a graphical user interface, which I neither
desire nor require.

``apt-cache show vim`` displays information that suggests this could be the
solution I've been searching for:

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ apt-cache show vim

    Many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
    highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
    completion, block operations, folding, Unicode support, etc.
    .
    This package contains a version of vim compiled with a rather
    standard set of features. This package does not provide a GUI
    version of Vim. See the other vim-* packages if you need more
    (or less).

``apt-cache show vim-nox`` reveals that ``vim-nox`` provides support for
scripting languages, including Python, which is absent in the minimal ``vim``
package.

So, I installed it:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c "apt-get install vim-nox"

The first thing I noticed after installing ``vim-nox`` is that now ``vi``
points to ``vim.nox``, meaning that when running ``vi`` it actually runs
``vim.nox``, which was unexpected.

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ whereis vi
   vi: /usr/bin/vi /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1.gz
   pionen@lilit:~$ ls -la /usr/bin/vi
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 May 28  2021 /usr/bin/vi -> /etc/alternatives/vi
   pionen@lilit:~$ ls -la /etc/alternatives/vi
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Oct 12  2022 /etc/alternatives/vi -> /usr/bin/vim.nox

I struggled to find a fix for this, but I eventually found the solution:

https://superuser.com/questions/852177/why-does-the-vi-command-open-vim-editor/852219#852219

I just needed to run ``vim`` and pass some parameters to avoid loading
additional features:

.. code-block:: console

   vim -u NONE

Later, I found the same suggestion in the ``/usr/share/vim/vim82/defaults.vim``
file:

.. code-block:: console

   " This is loaded if no vimrc file was found.
   " Except when Vim is run with "-u NONE" or "-C".
   " Individual settings can be reverted with ":set option&".
   " Other commands can be reverted as mentioned below.

This setup allows me to run ``vi`` without loading any additional features from
``vim-nox``, which is useful for quick edits without plugins. To simplify this,
I added the following alias to my ``~/.bash_aliases`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Alias to run vi without additional features
   alias vi="vim -u NONE"

With this configuration, I'm all set! In a future post, Iâ€™ll share my
``~/.vimrc`` file and its configuration details.
