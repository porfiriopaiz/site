JOSM is in my opinion the best editor for OpenStreetMap I have ever used and it
is also the best Java software I have ever used too.

In this post, I will cover how to get it installed on Debian and how to
properly configure it for mapping on OSM and what plugins to install and use.

Installing JOSM on Debian
=========================

JOSM is available on the Debian official repository, so for its installation,
you just need to open a terminal and type the next command:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'apt-get install josm'

Solving JOSM outdated version on Debian
=======================================

Installing JOSM from the official Debian repositories solves the dependency
issue we would find if we ran the most up-to-date version from the official
.jar build.

To run the most up-to-date stable version we need to download it from the
official JOSM website as a JAR file, but first, we need to run at least once
the version is installed from the Debian repository.

.. code-block:: console

   josm

This is going to create the next directory structure associated with it:

.. code-block:: console

   ~/.config/JOSM
   ~/.cache/JOSM
   ~/.local/share/JOSM

Under ``~/.cache/JOSM/`` will create a directory named ``jar``:

.. code-block:: console

   mkdir -p ~/.cache/JOSM/jar

Now let us move to that directory:

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/.cache/JOSM/jar

Now let's download the most up to date version of the JOSM editor using wget:

.. code-block:: console

   wget -N -t 0 -c https://josm.openstreetmap.de/josm-tested.jar

Now, to run the new version up to date version, we download:

.. code-block:: console

   java -jar ~/.cache/JOSM/jar/josm-tested.jar

Script launcher
===============

To launch the JAR file, we can add the last command to a file with executable
permissions:

.. code-block:: console

   touch ~/.local/bin/tested-josm.sh

Then add the following to it:

.. code-block:: console

   #! /bin/bash
   java -jar ~/.cache/JOSM/jar/josm-tested.jar

Adding a launcher
=================

To make this easier, let's create a launcher for the manually downloaded JOSM
JAR file and previously created script:

.. code-block:: console

   touch ~/.local/share/applications/org.openstreetmap.josm.desktop

And add the following:

.. code-block:: console

   [Desktop Entry]
   Type=Application
   Version=1.0
   Name=JOSM Tested
   GenericName=Java OpenStreetMap Editor
   Comment=Extensible off-line editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   Icon=org.openstreetmap.josm
   Exec=/home/pionen/.local/bin/tested-josm.sh
   Terminal=false
   MimeType=application/x-osm+xml;application/x-gpx+xml;application/geo+json;application/x-josm-session+xml;application/x-josm-session+zip;x-scheme-handler/geo;
   StartupNotify=true
   Categories=Education;Geoscience;Maps;
   StartupWMClass=org-openstreetmap-josm-MainApplication
   Keywords=OpenStreetMap;OSM;

The next time you restart your computer, you will find the new launcher, and by
just clicking on it, you will start the most up-to-date version of JOSM on
Debian.
