Software Repositories
=====================

Once you have resolved the problem of connecting to the Internet and launching
a terminal, you might want to install all the software you need.

Software in Fedora comes from repositories, referred to as *Software
Repositories*. Below, I detail the repositories I enable on all my Fedora
installations, apart from the official ones that come preinstalled and enabled
by default.

Open a terminal and enable some of these repositories.

RPM Fusion
----------

RPM Fusion is a repository of add-on packages for Fedora and EL+EPEL,
maintained by a group of volunteers. It is not a standalone repository but an
extension of Fedora. RPM Fusion distributes packages that are not acceptable
for inclusion in Fedora.

Learn more about RPM Fusion on its official website: https://rpmfusion.org/FAQ

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm'

Fedora Workstation Repositories
-------------------------------

From the Fedora Wiki page for Fedora Workstation Repositories:

The Fedora community strongly promotes free and open source resources.
Therefore, the Fedora Workstation, in its default configuration, only includes
free and open source software. To make Fedora Workstation more usable, we’ve
made it easy to install a curated set of third-party (external) sources that
supply software not included in Fedora through an additional package.

Read more at:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation/Third_Party_Software_Repositories

Note: This will only install the `.repo` files; it will not enable the provided
repositories:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories'

Fedora Rawhide's Repositories
-----------------------------

Rawhide is the name of the current development version of Fedora. It consists
of a package repository called "rawhide," containing the latest builds of all
Fedora packages, updated daily. Each day, an attempt is made to create a full
set of "deliverables" (installation images and so on), and all successfully
composed packages are included in the Rawhide tree for that day.

You can install its repository files and temporarily enable it for a single
transaction—for example, to install or upgrade a single package and its
dependencies. This is particularly useful when a bug fix exists in Rawhide but
has not yet reached the stable branches of Fedora.

Note: This will only install the `.repo` file under ``/etc/yum.repos.d/``; it
will not enable the repository. Later, we will see how to handle enabling and
disabling repositories for single transactions.

Learn more about Rawhide on its Wiki page:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install fedora-repos-rawhide'

COPR
----

COPR is an easy-to-use automatic build system that provides a package
repository as its output.

Here are some of the repositories I rely on:

neteler/remarkable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remarkable is a free, fully featured markdown editor.

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf -y copr enable neteler/remarkable'

philfry/gajim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gajim is a Jabber client written in PyGTK. It currently provides support for
the OMEMO encryption method, which I use. This repository provides tools and
dependencies not available in the official Fedora repository.

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf -y copr enable philfry/gajim'

dani/qgis
~~~~~~~~~

QGIS is a user-friendly open source Geographic Information System.

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf -y copr enable dani/qgis'

donet-sig/dotnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository provides the .NET CLI tools and runtime for Fedora.

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf copr enable @dotnet-sig/dotnet'

VSCodium
--------

A few weeks ago, I decided to try VSCodium, a fork of VSCode. Here is how to
enable its repository for Fedora.

First, import its GPG key so you can verify the packages retrieved from the
repository:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'rpm --import https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg'

Now create the `vscodium.repo` file:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c "tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/vscodium.repo << 'EOF'
   [gitlab.com_paulcarroty_vscodium_repo]
   name=gitlab.com_paulcarroty_vscodium_repo
   baseurl=https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/rpms/
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=1
   repo_gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg
   EOF
   "

Verification
============

Now check that all the repositories have been successfully installed and some
of them enabled by refreshing the `dnf` metadata:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf check-update'

That’s all. In the next post, we will see how to enable some of these
repositories, temporarily disable and enable others for single transactions,
install or upgrade specific packages from a particular repository, and perform
many repository administration tasks.
