When I was installing Debian on my Lenovo ThinkPad T440p, I could not find the
option to set up the local time, RTC time, and time zone to UTC as the
default configuration.

To fix this, I need to run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   timedatectl

This lists the current configuration:

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ timedatectl 
                  Local time: Thu 2021-07-15 14:45:28 CST
              Universal time: Thu 2021-07-15 20:45:28 UTC
                    RTC time: Thu 2021-07-15 20:44:47
                   Time zone: America/Managua (CST, -0600)
   System clock synchronized: yes
                 NTP service: active
             RTC in local TZ: yes

   Warning: The system is configured to read the RTC time in the local time zone.
            This mode cannot be fully supported. It will create various problems
            with time zone changes and daylight saving time adjustments. The RTC
            time is never updated; it relies on external facilities to maintain it.
            If at all possible, use RTC in UTC by calling
            'timedatectl set-local-rtc 0'.

First, let's update the RTC to use UTC:

.. code-block:: console

   timedatectl set-local-rtc 0

Next, let's set the time zone and the local time zone to UTC:

.. code-block:: console

   timedatectl set-timezone UTC

Now, our system will be fully synchronized with UTC:

.. code-block:: console

   pionen@lilit:~$ timedatectl 
                  Local time: Thu 2021-07-15 21:31:52 UTC
              Universal time: Thu 2021-07-15 21:31:52 UTC
                    RTC time: Thu 2021-07-15 21:31:52
                   Time zone: UTC (UTC, +0000)
   System clock synchronized: yes
                 NTP service: active
             RTC in local TZ: no
