Add a New Keyboard Shortcut for Sleep Mode
==========================================

You can create a custom keyboard shortcut to put your MacBook into Sleep
mode without closing the lid by following these steps:

1. **Open System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS
   versions): You can do this by clicking the **Apple menu** in the
   top-left corner of your screen and selecting "**System Settings**"
   (or "System Preferences").
2. **Navigate to Keyboard**: In the sidebar, click on "**Keyboard**."
3. **Go to Keyboard Shortcuts**: Click the "**Keyboard Shortcuts...**"
   button at the bottom of the Keyboard settings.
4. **Select App Shortcuts**: In the left-hand column of the Keyboard
   Shortcuts window, select "**App Shortcuts**."
5. **Add a New Shortcut**: Click the "**+**" button below the right-
   hand column.
6. **Configure the Shortcut**:
   * **Application**: Make sure "**All Applications**" is selected
     (this is usually the default).
   * **Menu Title**: This is crucial. You need to type the **exact
     name** of the menu item that puts your Mac to sleep. Go to the
     **Apple menu** (top left of your screen) and look for "**Sleep**."
     It's usually just "Sleep." Type exactly "**Sleep**" (without the
     quotes) into the "Menu Title" field.
   * **Keyboard Shortcut**: Click in the "Keyboard Shortcut" field and
     then press the key combination you want to use for sleep. A common
     and convenient one is **Control + Shift + Eject** (if your
     MacBook has an Eject key) or **Control + Shift + Power button**
     (on newer MacBooks without an Eject key). You can also choose
     something like **Control + Command + S** if you prefer (which I did). Just
     make sure it's a combination you won't accidentally press often.
7. **Click Done** (or Add): Once you've entered the menu title and
   your desired shortcut, click "**Done**" (or "Add" on older macOS
   versions).

Now, whenever you press your newly created keyboard shortcut, your
MacBook should go into Sleep mode without you having to close the lid.
