:lang: en

From May 26, 2015, to November 22, 2016, I enjoyed a smooth experience running
Fedora 22 on my Lenovo ThinkPad T440pâ€”a solid year and a half of tech bliss.
However, on July 19, 2016, Fedora 22 officially entered its `End of Life (EOL)
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life>`_ phase. This meant no more
security or maintenance updates, prompting the need to upgrade to a newer,
stable version.

In this post, I'll walk you through the process of upgrading to Fedora 23 using
the reliable DNF package manager. Letâ€™s keep your Fedora system running fresh
and secure! ðŸš€

.. TEASER_END

Over the course of 18 months using Fedora 22, the package cache had accumulated
approximately 10 GB of space on my hard drive.

To instruct DNF to retain downloaded packages in the cache, add the following
line to the DNF configuration file located at ``/etc/dnf/dnf.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

    su -c "echo 'keepcache = true' >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf"

Upgrading to Fedora 23
======================

Prerequisites for Upgrading
---------------------------

1. Ensure there is sufficient space on your ``/`` partition. This is necessary
because the upgrade process involves downloading the latest version of every
package installed on your system. To free up space, if needed, you can clear
the stored package cache:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf clean all'

2. Ensure your system is up-to-date by rebuilding the metadata cache and
applying any pending updates:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf makecache'

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf upgrade'

Install the DNF System Upgrade Plugin
-------------------------------------

**DNF System Upgrade** enables the upgrade to a newer Fedora version using a
mechanism similar to offline updates. Packages are downloaded during regular
system operation, and a reboot triggers their installation in a dedicated
environment.

Install the required plugin with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade'

Download the Packages
---------------------

Next, download the necessary packages for the upgrade to Fedora 23. This step
ensures that every package currently installed on your system is replaced with
its latest version for Fedora 23:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --best --allowerasing --releasever=23'

The screenshot below shows the details of the packages to be downloaded and
their total size:

You can also upgrade to newer versions such as Fedora 24, 25, or even Rawhide.
However, I recommend avoiding skipping more than one release (a ``n + 2``
jump). At the time of writing, the latest stable versions are Fedora 24 and 25,
with Fedora 26 in the `Branched
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Branched>`_ state and `Rawhide
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide>`_ as the rolling development
version.

To upgrade to another version, adjust the ``--releasever`` parameter:

- Upgrade to Fedora 24:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --best --allowerasing --releasever=24'

- Upgrade to Fedora 25:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --best --allowerasing --releasever=25'

- Upgrade to Rawhide:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --best --allowerasing --releasever=rawhide'

Reboot to Apply the Upgrade
---------------------------

After downloading the packages, reboot your system to initiate the upgrade
process:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf system-upgrade reboot'

This command will restart the system. Upon reboot, the upgrade process will
begin, using the newly downloaded packages. Once complete, your system will be
running Fedora 23.
