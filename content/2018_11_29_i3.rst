In this post, I will explain how to perform a Fedora 29 installation with the
i3 window manager. It is common to find installation guides for i3, but they
often assume you already have another desktop environment installed.

Here, we will see how to build a fully functional environment starting from a
minimal installation, as I have explained in previous posts.

Creating an Installation Medium
===============================

Downloading the Fedora Everything Netinstall ISO
------------------------------------------------

From the site: https://alt.fedoraproject.org/, download the file in the
*Everything* section. This ISO allows network-based installation, downloading
all necessary packages from the Internet. It also provides the option to choose
which package collections to install, unlike Live media, which comes with
predefined software selections.

Download the ISO with `wget`:

.. code-block:: console

   wget -N -t 0 -c https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/29/Everything/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Everything-netinst-x86_64-29-1.2.iso

Also, download the integrity check file:

.. code-block:: console

   wget -N -t 0 -c https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/29/Everything/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Everything-29-1.2-x86_64-CHECKSUM

Verify the integrity of the file:

.. code-block:: console

   sha256sum -c Fedora-Everything-29-1.2-x86_64-CHECKSUM

Creating the Installation Medium with Fedora Media Writer
---------------------------------------------------------

Fedora Media Writer is available for various operating systems. Download the
appropriate version from:

https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter/releases/tag/4.1.1

Using Fedora Media Writer ensures the installation medium will support booting
on both UEFI and BIOS systems. The boot mode depends on which has higher
priority during startup. I always use UEFI exclusively, so all my systems are
installed in UEFI mode.

Once Fedora Media Writer is installed, connect your USB drive, run the
application, and use the *Custom Image* option to navigate to the downloaded
ISO. Select the USB drive carefully and write the image to the drive.

Installation
============

Follow the installation steps described in this previous post, ensuring access
to a wireless or wired network:

https://porfiriopaiz.github.io/blog/posts/anaconda-y-lvm-sobre-luks.html

During installation, I used my mobile phone to create a wired network via USB.
While I had wireless access during the base system installation (Fedora Custom
Install), the selected package collection lacked the necessary drivers for
wireless connectivity.

To use a USB tethered network, follow these steps after the first boot:

1. Log in to the system.
2. Connect the USB cable to your computer and mobile phone.
3. Ensure the phone is connected to Wi-Fi or has an active data plan. You will need at least 800 MB of data for downloading the required RPM packages.
4. Put the phone in USB or MTP data transfer mode.
5. Enable a wired network (USB tethering) on your mobile phone.

Verify the connection by pinging Google:

.. code-block:: console

   ping 8.8.8.8

Basic Configurations
====================

Configuring `dnf`
-----------------

As root, I configure `dnf` for optimal performance. This step is optional:

Enable the fastest mirrors:

.. code-block:: console

   echo 'fastestmirror=true' >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

Disable delta RPMs for faster downloads (optional):

.. code-block:: console

   echo 'deltarpm=false' >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

Keep the package cache for the lifetime of the Fedora release (optional):

.. code-block:: console

   echo 'keepcache=true' >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

Disable unnecessary `dnf` services and timers to save bandwidth and avoid
locks:

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl disable dnf-makecache.service

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl disable dnf-makecache.timer

Reboot to apply the changes:

.. code-block:: console

   reboot

Updating the System
-------------------

After installation, your system may not include the latest updates. Refresh the
metadata cache and install updates:

As a normal user:

.. code-block:: console

   dnf clean all

.. code-block:: console

   dnf makecache

As root:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf clean all'

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf makecache'

Check for updates:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf --refresh check-upgrade'

If updates are available, install them:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf upgrade'

Reboot if updates include critical components like the kernel:

.. code-block:: console

   reboot

Installing i3
=============

Install the i3 window manager and necessary components. All commands must be
executed as root.

Install required groups and packages:

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install core

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install networkmanager-submodules

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install fonts

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install multimedia

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install base-x

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install standard

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y group install input-methods

.. code-block:: console

   dnf -y install i3 lightdm-gtk xdg-user-dirs

Enable the graphical boot mode and LightDM:

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl set-default graphical.target

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl enable lightdm.service

Reboot the system:

.. code-block:: console

   reboot

First Graphical Session
=======================

Upon first login, i3 will prompt you to generate a configuration file. Press
Enter to confirm. Choose your preferred modifier key (e.g., the Windows or Meta
key).

Installing Additional Software
==============================

This setup does not include preinstalled tools like a web browser or file
manager. You can install them as needed. For example, to install GNOME
Terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install gnome-terminal'

Use `dmenu` to launch applications:

- Press `<Win> + d` and type `gnome-terminal` to open the terminal.

Logging Out and Powering Off
============================

To log out from i3:

- Press `<Win> + <Shift> + e` and confirm.

To power off from LightDM:

- Press `<Alt> + <F4>`.

This guide provides a streamlined way to set up i3 on Fedora 29, ideal for
lightweight virtual machines or older hardware with limited resources.
