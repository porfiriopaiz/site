:summary: Upgrading from Debian 12.12 to Debian 13.3
:lang: en

Previously, I have upgraded from Debian 11.11 to Debian 12.12. On this post I
will be upgrading from Debian 12.12 to Debian 13.3.

----

Pre-upgrade Process
-------------------

Confirm the installed Debian version just to make sure where we are starting
from:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /etc/debian_version

Which returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   12.12

Gather System Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command gives us more information about the current version installed on our
device:

.. code-block:: bash

   lsb_release -a

Which returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   Distributor ID:	Debian
   Description:		Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
   Release:		12
   Codename:		bookworm

This is another alternative to get even more information about the installed 
system version:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /etc/os-release

Which returns:

.. code-block:: bash

   PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)"
   NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
   VERSION_ID="12"
   VERSION="12 (bookworm)"
   VERSION_CODENAME=bookworm
   ID=debian
   HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
   SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
   BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"

----

Storage Analysis
----------------

Before upgrading, I wanted to know how much storage space I have used since 
Debian 11 was installed on my T440p.

Analyze APT Cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, I moved to the directory where ``apt`` stores the packages before they are
installed on the system:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /var/cache/apt

Once there, I ran this command to measure the total storage space used:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo du -sh .

Which returned the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   31G	/var/cache/apt/

Meaning that in 4 years, I have downloaded 31 GB either as new packages or 
updates for existing packages.

----

Package Inventory
-----------------

Something important to me before upgrading is to make a list of all the 
packages currently installed.

Methods to List Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Selection List**: Saves a basic list to ``packagesInstalled``.
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     dpkg --get-selections > packagesInstalled

- **Detailed Query**: Includes status, version, and architecture.
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     dpkg-query -l > dpkgQuery-l

- **Binary Names Only**: Useful for clean, one-per-line lists.
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W > dpkgQuery-f_binPac

- **Manual Selections**: Lists packages specifically requested by the user.
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     apt-mark showmanual > manuallyInstalled

----

The Upgrade Process
-------------------

OK... enough nostalgia for the moment; this is where the fun begins!

Update Current System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it is, I need to make sure that my system is fully up to date:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Modify Package Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, make a backup of your current configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.orig

Then, update the file to switch the codename to **Trixie**:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /etc/apt/
   sudo sed -i.bak '/^deb-src\|^deb/ s/bookworm/trixie/g' /etc/apt/sources.list

Perform the Full Upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update the repository data:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update

Check for upgradable packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt list --upgradable

We will upgrade first without installing new packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs

Once this is completed, we can fully upgrade our system:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt full-upgrade

----

Conclusion
----------

Once this process was completed, I was able to reboot my system and run Debian
13.3 on my Lenovo ThinkPad T440p without having to reinstall from scratch.
