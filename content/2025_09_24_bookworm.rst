So previously I have posted about to confirm what was the age of my currently
installed Debian 11.11, the one I have been runing since 2021, as I could not
remember the exact date and time it was installed on my laptop.

I was able to find a couple of possible options, which I shared on this post:

https://porfiriopaiz.github.io/site/posts/2025/08/24/debian-age.html

Now, after more that 4 years of using Debian 11.11, I have finally decided to
upgrade to Debian 12.12 Bookworm. I will cover the steps I took to perform the
upgrade, and some of the issues I faced during the process.

Also, I will share with you some of the things I wanted to preserve from the
current installation before the upgrade process.
