:lang: en

I don't like Flatpaks. They are heavy, take up a lot of space, and consume a
significant amount of RAM. However, when it comes to installing proprietary
software that is not available in the official Fedora repositories, Flatpaks
can be a good option since they provide a certain level of isolation.

Flatpak Installation
====================

To install Flatpak, run:

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install flatpak'

Enable Flathub Repository
=========================

To enable the Flathub repository, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

Some popular examples of software available via Flathub include:

- `Riot <https://flathub.org/apps/details/im.riot.Riot>`_
- `Skype <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.skype.Client>`_
- `Signal <https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.signal.Signal>`_
- `Slack <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.slack.Slack>`_
- `Spotify <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.spotify.Client>`_
- `Wire <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.wire.WireDesktop>`_

I prefer not to install Flatpaks in the root directory. Instead, I always use
the ``--user`` flag to ensure Flatpaks are installed under my ``~/`` directory.

Example command to install a Flatpak:

.. code-block:: console

   flatpak --user install flathub im.riot.Riot
