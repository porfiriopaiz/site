:lang: en

I don't like Flatpaks, Flatpaks are heavy, space consuming, high on ram
consuming resources. But when it comes about installing propietary software not
available on the official Fedora repos, Flatpaks are a good option as they add
some sort of isolation.

Flatpak installation
====================

.. code-block:: console

   su -c 'dnf install flatpak'

Enable Flathub repo
===================

Add the Flathub repo:

.. code-block:: console

   flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

Some good examples are:

- `Riot <https://flathub.org/apps/details/im.riot.Riot>`_
- `Skype <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.skype.Client>`_
- `Signal <https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.signal.Signal>`_
- `Slack <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.slack.Slack>`_
- `Spotify <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.spotify.Client>`_
- `Wire <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.wire.WireDesktop>`_

I don't like to install Flatpaks on my root directory, so I always add the
``--user`` flag to make sure Flatpaks are installed under my ``~/`` directory.

.. code-block:: console

   flatpak --user install flathub im.riot.Riot
